We are happy to announce, that our idea of developing a foodsaving web application and a local website to implement it in Taiwan is generously supported by [g0v.tw](https://grants.g0v.tw/projects/5968ee2fd60a0d001ed1f7d1).

During the upcoming six month we will use the grant money to work on the app as well as the website and cover some of our costs here in Taiwan. A test version of our software KARROT can be found [here](https://dev.karrot.world/#/groupPreview).
