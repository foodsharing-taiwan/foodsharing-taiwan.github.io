# How to get active

Since April 2016 we are daily picking up food from cooperating stores in Taipei.

People who are interested in picking up food are required to sign a [legal agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3xaZ_QoJKPfdUNjdWxaLVBWNEE/view?usp=sharing) with us accepting our terms and conditions.

Afterwards we will send you a Foodsharing ID, which makes you an official Foodsharing volunteer, a so called Foodsaver. With the ID you will be able to log in into the software and identify yourself as a Foodsaver at our partner stores.

If there are cooperating stores in your neighbourhood you can just start pick up food there or help us to set up new cooperations.

During the last 19 month we were able to daily pick up surplus food, that otherwise would have been wasted, at a cooperating bakery. Based on a daily average amount of surplus food of about 3 kg we could save more than ONE TON (1000 kg) of food from one bakery in one year.

We are currently looking for new cooperations and are preparing our new software (KARROT) to help us organise our pick up and manage our cooperations.

If you are interested to join us as a Foodsaver or cooperting food retailer, check out our flyers and donâ€™t hesitate to contact us!

We organize our volunteer food pick-ups through KARROT.
