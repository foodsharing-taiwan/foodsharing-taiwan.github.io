# Community

The idea of Foodsharing Taiwan is to get togehter to fight food waste in Taiwan.

Therefore is it important to us to cooperate with other groups working on this issue in Taiwan.

If you are interested in working with us on foodwaste, we are happy to hear from you.

Our last [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1488546647928864/) was held togehter with:

[Pick Food Up 扌合 生態廚房](https://www.facebook.com/pickfoodup/)

[格外有意思](https://www.facebook.com/ProjectOffGrades/)

[廢青不廢 共同合辦](https://www.facebook.com/TWZeroWasteYouth/)

We hope to have many more events in the future, inform more people about the issue of food waste and cooperate with other groups to fight food waste in Taiwan together!

# Lots more to come, stay tuned!
