# Community

There are so many ways to make a difference in your life and around you. One of the them is to Join Us and start taking action today towards a better future . Being a part of our family means getting together to fight food waste in Taiwan.

🍉 Volunteer 
<br />Our community's impact is made possible by those who share their free time to collect food, set up and carry out the food sharing and all the other events we host. Give it a try, join us and see if sharing food is for you. There is no commitment and everyone is welcome!

🍉 Core Team
<br />Become part of our core team and help with administration, volunteer management, food collection, design, translation and events. 

🍉 Groups and Venues
<br />For us it is important to do networking to bring together like-minded people and initiatives in Taiwan to set up events and activities together or just get together and exchange ideas.

🍉 Foodsharing Worldwide
<br />Foodsharing is a global and distributed movement against food waste. Our main method is to save food from being thrown away. This is done via cooperations with stores, restaurants and any kind of business, that handles food.
Besides the global initiative of [Foodsaving World](https://foodsaving.world/en) there are many local groups all over the world such as [Foodsharing Germany](https://foodsharing.de/), [Foodsharing Copenhagen](http://foodsharingcph.org/), [Foodsharing Scotland](http://www.foodsharing.scot/) and so on.

In Taiwan we have so far collaborated with

[Pick Food Up 扌合 生態廚房](https://www.facebook.com/pickfoodup/)

[格外有意思](https://www.facebook.com/ProjectOffGrades/)

[廢青不廢 共同合辦](https://www.facebook.com/TWZeroWasteYouth/)

[人生百味](https://www.facebook.com/Do.you.a.flavor/)

[Greenpeace Taiwan 綠色和平](http://www.greenpeace.org/taiwan/zh/)

We hope to have many more events in the future, inform more people about the issue of food waste and cooperate with other groups to fight food waste in Taiwan together!

If you are interested in becoming part of the community and working with us on reducing food waste, we are happy to hear from you.

# Lots more to come, stay tuned!
