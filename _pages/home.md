# Share food instead of wasting it!

## About us

Foodsharing Taiwan is a grassroots initiative. The goal is to organise redistribution, meaning unconditional sharing, of food waste. We believe that this waste is public property and should be shared in a non-exclusive and non-commercial way.

Our initiative is building upon the already existing initiative Foodsharing Germany. It has so far been successfull with saving tons and tons of food waste and making it possible for more and more people to involve themselves actively in the issues of wasteflow.

## Who?

Anybody can be involved! We are an open group of humans joining forces to make this idea reality in Denmark.

## How does it work?

There is so-called “foodsavers“. Their job is to convince the company wasting food to share it with Foodsharing Taiwan instead of throwing it to the dumpster and to arrange pick-up times. Later in this process, the foodsavers bring the saved food to another publicly announced location. Then there is people like me and you, who these foodsavers gather food for. We simply go to one of the several pick-up locations in town when there is Foodsharing Taiwan event and get our share, or maybe even carry it further to our friends and neighbours.
