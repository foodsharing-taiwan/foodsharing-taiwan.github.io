# Share food, don’t waste it!!

## About us

Foodsharing Taiwan is a grassroots initiative to systematically fight occurring food waste by organizing cooperations with stores on a large scale in an easily manageable way.
Foodsharing is only possible and necessary because we face a massive amount of food waste. About one third of the globally produced food is thrown away. 
Anybody can get involved! We are an open group of humans joining forces to make this idea reality in Taiwan. At the moment we focus our work on Taipei, but we hope to expand to other parts of Taiwan soon.

## How does it work?

Our main focus lays on building and maintaining cooperations with food retailers, like bakeries, stores, coffee shops, restaurants and so on, so that they can reduce their garbage and save food together with us. Therefore, volunteers (so called Foodsaver) pick up and redistribute any food that would otherwise be dumped. In order to prevent any risk for a cooperating food retailer, every Foodsaver has to sign a Legal Arrangement, which includes a disclaimer of warranty in accordance with the Taiwanese law. Thus the Foodsaver agrees to take full responsibility distributing and consuming the food, so that you absolutely don’t need to fear any risk of liability concerning food quality issues. 
Foodsaver are free to decide what to do with the food they picked up by themselves. Our focus is not charity, but saving food from being wasted. We see ourselves as complement to charitable organizations such as Food Banks. We absolutely give priority to these organisations, want to support and cooperate with them. 
We are also setting up public fridges, where everybody can exchange food with each other!

## Why should you join us?

You can make a contribution cutting food waste by becoming a Foodsaver helping us to set up cooperations and picking up food! Or you are a food retailer, allow us to pick up your surplus food and thereby show your customers that you cherish food! 

We would like to invite you to join the Foodsharing movement in Taiwan and we are happy about anything you have to offer!  So if you like our idea and are interested in supporting our project or have any further questions please don’t hesitate to contact us.
