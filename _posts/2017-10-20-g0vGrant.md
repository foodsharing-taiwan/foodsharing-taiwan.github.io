#g0v grant
We are happy to announce, that our idea of developing a foodsaving web application and a local website to implement it in Taiwan is generously supported by g0v.tw.

During the upcoming six month we will use the grant money to work on the app as well as the website and cover some of our costs here in Taiwan.
